Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

Solution:

 ``` sql
With subs as(
select S.customer_id
		,P.plan_name
        ,S.start_date
  from Plans P join subscriptions S using(plan_id)
  )
  
  select * from subs 
  where customer_id IN (1,10,25,150,300,500,750,1000);
 ```
